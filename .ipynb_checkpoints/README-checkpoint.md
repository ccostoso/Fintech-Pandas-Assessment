# Time Series Analysis with Pandas

As a bona fide FinTech professional, you might find yourself looking into home values in a given market, the profit margins of a hot new start-up or the growth trends of a freshly-minted cryptocurrency. Making informed decisions about where to invest requires powerful tools that can drive a high volume of calucations in a short amount of time—and that's where Pandas comes in.

## Background

Pandas is a beloved toolset that extends Python functionality with methods that can import data, reveal patterns and even display visually-compelling charts on the fly! Pandas is used by FinTech gurus just like yourself to help us analyze numbers and make them understanable not just to you, but to your clients.

We'll be leveraging JupyterLab to help us master Pandas. Jupyter is an Python environment that allows us to run our code and see the results in clean, well-organized documents.

Finally, we'll make use of spre-made CSV (that is, comma-separated value) files which store the data we'll be analyzing. Think of a CSV file as a rudimentary spreadsheet with columns of data separated by—you guessed it—commas. We'll import this file using Pandas and figure out which stocks can give us a higher return on investment.

### What is Time Series Analysis?

Among other things, working in FinTech means reading data and drawing conclusions about where to invest our funds. In order to draw conclusions about potential profitability, we can examine the performance of a financial asset, such as a stock in a company, and determine whether or not it would be prudent to spend money on it.

### How can Pandas help with Time Series Analysis?

Pandas offers us a handy way to visualize, organize and analyze this data: DataFrames. DataFrames are the foundation of time series analysis with Pandas, because they come with an array of methods that automate tasks such as calculating hour-by-hour gains or losses, trimming a data set of empty values or creating a wide variety of charts to help us visualize trends. We *could* do any of these tasks on our own, cell by cell or row by row—but even if we're working with a small dataset, this can be time consuming and quite taxing mentally. Just imagine a spreadsheet with hundreds or even thousands of rows, each with data about a stock's performance minute-by-minute—analyzing *that* without any automation to asssit us would be a nightmare!

## Files

## Instructions

To start, we'll navigate to our folder in our Terminal (macOS) or in Git Bash (Windows). Once there, we'll run

`conda activate dev`

in order to activate our Python dev environment.

From here, we'll open JuptyerLab with the command

`jupyter lab`

In our terminal, we'll see our output from our JupyterLab server as it starts up. Afterwards, we should see our default browser open up with JupyterLab open.
